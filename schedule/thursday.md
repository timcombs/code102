# Thursday

* 6:00pm - Git: Pull Request Prep
  * Create a `feature/thursday` branch
  * Tonight we're going to do things a little bit differently
  * Create a notes/thursday-yourgitusername.md file and add it to the repo (e.g. `notes/thursday-bethadele.md`)
  * Take notes in this file through the evening
* 6:10pm - JavaScript: Control Flow & Chrome Browser Tools
  * Use [code/thursday.html](/code/thursday.html) and [code/thursday.js](/code/thursday.js)
* 7:30pm - Prework (you should be at least 80% complete by the end of class)
* 8:15 - Git: Pull Requests
  * Save and commit your work on your repo **in your feature branch** (don't merge to master)
  * Push your work to your repo (`git push origin feature/thursday`)
  * Now do a pull request from your repo's "Pull Request" page to the master branch of one of your classmate's repos
  * By the end of the evening, everyone should have made a pull request **and** responded to a pull request
  * Note that if you make changes in your branch and push before the pull request is accepted or closed, the pull request updates automagically
* 8:30pm - Recap, Q&A
